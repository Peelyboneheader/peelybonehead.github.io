  <h1><strong>The Problem of the Overconsumption of Fossil-Fuel Sourced Energy in the United States</strong></h1>
  <h2>And Why the Solution to that is Solar Panels </h2>
 <h6>Jacob Lee & Eric Zeng</h6>
<p>As you wander down the sidewalk in your city, you smell and taste something odd but don't see anything. Then, suddenly, a burning sensation rips throughout your throat, and you cough and cough over and over. Soon, your coughing fit ends, leaving you to wonder what almost killed you. The answer: Gasoline </p>

       <p>Gasoline is a transparent liquid made from petroleum usually used in combustion engines, like care engines. Gasoline is a refined form of fossil fuels, and is why fossil fuels and gasoline are used interchangeably in the text. It is very flammable and can react violently with other substances, with the ability to produce massive explosions that can injure or kill hundreds. It is also a finite resource, and can run out in the next half a century. It is a dangerous and powerful material that has to be handled with respect.</p>

  <h2>How the Expenditure of Fossil Fuels is Impacting our World</h2>
  
   <article class="browser">
  <h3>The Negative Impacts of Fossil Fuel Energy: Climate Change and Our Society</h3>
  <p> The use of fossil fuels—mainly petroleum—engendered climate change in the recent decades. One of the reason how we know that climate change is happening is because the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is far greater than any period of time in the last hundred millennia; the industrial activities that our modern civilization depends on have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from 280 ppm to the staggering amount of 416 ppm in the last 150 years (NASA). This exponential rise of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is due to the uncontrollable use of fossil fuel around the world. Scientists recently predicted many effects of our headstrong ignorance of climate change. The changes are at such a grand scale that it is difficult for people to wrap their minds around the global catastrophes predicted in the years to come. One future consequence of climate change is that the temperatures will continue to rise at an alarming rate. More people will have severe sunburns and skin cancer as well as suffer from heat stroke. The burning temperatures will cause droughts that will make prosperous farms very arid and expired, which accordingly will result in millions of desperate people migrating. Turbulent waves of migration more often than not result in catastrophic effects for the whole of humanity, with regards to the global economy, social order, and prosperity (Abrahm Lustgarten, Where Will They Go). The frequent droughts that sweep the farmlands will also inevitably result in cataclysmic hunger and malnutrition crisis all over the globe. 
     In addition, wildfires will become more frequent due to the aridity of dry lands. The wildfires will slaughter millions of innocent animals and destroy entire forests. The warmer temperatures will also warm our oceans as it absorbs heat waves; it will result in enormously strong and frequent hurricanes that will sink islands like Japan and New Zealand and swarm the edges of all coastlines (NASA). The warmer temperatures will melt the mountains such as the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa. They will also melt Antarctica and the Arctic poles in the North and South. In fact, studies show that all areas surrounding the North pole will melt before the mid century (NASA). The molten water will then raise the sea level up to eight feet by 2100 and will continue to rise for a long time since oceans take a long time to respond to warmer conditions on the Earth’s surface (NASA). The additional heat waves on the Earth's air will make the water vapors evaporate more and more therefore increase heat being trapped under the Earth's atmosphere. The evaporated water will then pour down on Earth all at once, causing problems such as irregular precipitation patterns, intensive hail and rain, huge floods, and crop failures. In terms of crops, frost-free seasons and growing seasons will lengthen; this will make growing crops monumentally more difficult (NASA). Other effects of climate change include health risks through air temperatures, water crisis, increasing spread of pests and pathogens, loss of biodiversity, ocean acidification, and much more (NASA). 
     Because of these catastrophic effects on earth, many people will die more than ever and migrate due to loss of jobs. The balance of socioeconomic status of the world will crumble, and hence riots are likely to frequent the streets and anarchy might arise in many nations. Many of these effects are already taking place all over the world and it will worsen if we do not limit and stop our fossil fuel-sourced energy consumption.</p>
<p>Also, A spill or accident can and will pose a massive danger to civilian businesses and households. In many cases, they can be contained and land be evacuated. However, there will still be massive explosions leaving casualties. They can also, if evacuated, cause economic impacts as businesses will not be able to have customers. As someone who knows small business owners, knowing they are not able to serve the community, making thousands of lives happier, and selling something people want, and then closing down and having millions in debt would absolutely ruin their lives just from a loose spill of deadly, dangerous petroleum would break me.</p>

  <h3>   Effects of Fossil Fuels on The Environment</h3>
<p>Oil leakages and accidents can be detrimental to local wildlife, like a forest or ocean environment, which can then go on to affect humans and their daily lives. Moreover, they take up a massive amount of space reserved for wildlife—over 12 million acres of public space equivalent to about 6 Yellowstone National Parks—thus removing large amounts of vegetation from these sites.</p>
<p>Air pollution from burning gas and environmental pollution from spilling and improper disposal can cause drastic effects on plants and animals. Humans are already affected by pollution, with 8 million men, women, and children killed each year. Think of the drastic effect that would happen to poor plants and animals just trying to live their life. Plants would be choked to death when faced deep in gas and animals regularly die from gas poisoning. Gas leakage also inflames climate change, feeding the fire for more environmental damage. Which will lead to rising oceans, and the eventual need to relocate billions from the coasts.</p>

     <p> Major spills like the BP oil spill cause drastic effects on marine life too. These oil spills will ruin oceanic ecosystems. This will poison local wildlife, including fish, which will swim all the way to the coast of our shores, and when caught and sold, can inflict poisoning, even if you were nowhere near the spill. 1 million birds alone died from the spill, ~60,000 sea turtles were killed, and all cetaceans nearby were found to be affected by the spill. Dolphins and whales became plagued with sickness from ingesting loose oil in the water. The spill worsened the endangered status of many species in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

      <h3>Potential Negative Effects on Our World</h3>
  <p> Fossil fuels are starting to run out as they are a finite resource at the rate we are consuming it. However, many developing countries are building their economies and livelihoods off of oil and would struggle to survive in an oil free world, worsening many situations for innocent souls. World oil reserves are running out and are expected to dry up by around 2060, and finding/drilling more, deeper oil would be expensive.</p>
<p>   There are many ideas to drill for oil reserves that are deeper in our Earth's crust, with one of the most promising being Hydrofracking, which is a method of blasting water into the ground to make it easier to find. However, it is extremely expensive and can destroy ecosystems, by means of leaking massive amounts of methane into our atmosphere. Worsening global warming, and since there are no good ways to fetch that deep oil, since they are too expensive.</p>
<p>   Losing all the oil will cause a major economic impact if it goes away, which is coming soon. Many countries are heavily reliant on oil, like Saudi Arabia, which has 46% of their GDP from oil and will be shaken from a world with less oil reliance. 8 countries in the world have above 90% of their exports being fuel, like oil and natural gas and such. 22 Countries have 50% or above of their exports being fuel. Many nations, mostly developing, are relying on their oil to make money, a finite resource that will run out in an estimated 50 years at our current consumption rate, a rate that grows every hour of the second, every minute of the day and will most likely exhaust our reserves faster. Those who will have their economies crashed by more expensive oil prices will be spiraling into a hole of debt and suffering, ruining the already struggling 6.61 dollars in South Africa and related countries to having no job exacerbating their poverty. </p>

  <h3>What Can we Use to Replace This Evil in Our World?</h3>
  <h4>The Answer? Solar Panels.</h4>

  <p> While solar energy is not totally efficient in terms of LCOE, for commerical use, it is considered cheaper in the long run. Energy harnessed from the sun have different solar power to electricity conversion rates, with the most efficient panel being around 39 percent efficient even when the average efficiency available for the average consumer is around 20 percent. However, in recent times, scientists are trying and figuring out how to improve the overall effectiveness of solar panels and are raising these numbers ever so slightly, with a 0.5 percent increase from a few years ago. Scientists are slowly but surely closing in on the goal of 50 percent, which they believe they can achieve. The energy received from solar panels can also increase property value and save homeowners potentially thousands of dollars each year from electricity bills. Solar panels will also significantly reduce greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and also reduce water consumption and withdrawal. The US government is also heavily incentivizing the strategy of going Solar by installing tax credits around 20-30 percent off solar taxes. Regardless, the cost of going to solar energy is going down each year. </p>
<p>Solar power is becoming increasingly attractive in the 21st century as fossil fuels slowly run out and climate change propel dire changes. The sun is an extremely powerful energy source and its intensity at the Earth’s surface can be easily and quickly harnessed and exploited.<p>
   <p>  Solar power is also becoming more efficient as photovoltaic technology rapidly develops. Solar-cell efficiency refers to the portion of energy in the form of sunlight that can be converted into electricity by a solar cell. The efficiency of solar panels has improved dramatically in recent years. From an average of around 15% conversion of sunlight into usable energy, that rate has risen up to around 20%. High-efficiency solar panels can reach as much as nearly 23%, which may not seem like a lot but with due consideration of just how much the world uses electricity, 3% is a very significant amount. The energy coming from the sun is practically limitless. The surface of the Earth receives solar energy at an average of 343 W/m^2. The Earth’s surface area is about 5 x 10^14 m^2 so we would get 1715x10^14W. However 30% of this is reflected and only 30% of the Earth is above sea level. Furthermore, since we don’t want to cut down lush forest, reduce the area by about one half. Taking into account these limitations, over the course of a year, this amount of solar energy adds up to 66x10^22 Joules, which is more than 10,000 times what we need! This calculation is assuming that the solar cell efficiency will stay the same so presumably the amount of solar energy potential will be much higher.</p>
    <p> The potential for solar energy is utterly massive. Solar energy is proven by numerous occasions to be effective for climate change mitigation. As climate change becomes further and further of a problem for humanity in the upcoming decades, solar energy will be the most practical and viable solution to mitigate and quite possibly stop climate change once and for all. Another great potential for photovoltaic energy arises from the expanding ventures of space exploration and colonization. As from the dawn of the 21st century, government ogranizations and private investors alike are constantly endeavoring to explore outer space and venture out into the uncharted worlds. Billions are spent every in the space industry, which is growing by the minuite. However, in order for more future expeditions to happen, a stable source of energy in outer space is desperately needed. Fossil fuels cannot be transported to outer space colonies and cannot be found whatsoever outside of Earth. Nuclear fusion is currently unproductive and expensive with today's technology; also, nuclear fission energy power plants are extremely difficult to set up in outer space. With all due consideration of every mode of energy man-kind can exploit, bio-fuels (expensive to produce and transport), geothermal (impractical), hydro-electric (no potential sites outside of Earth), wind power, it is evident that solar energy is the most ideal source of energy for the growing space industry.</p>
  <p>   The traditional American consumerism trends have been reporting record amounts of electricity consumption over the past few decades. The myriad of problems that arise from this exccesive overconsumption can be solved with solar sourced energy.</p>

      <h3>Are Solar Panels Really Realistic Though?</h3>
      <p> It actually is, since The US government is offering many discounts, placing chances for getting 20-30 percent off your solar taxes depending on when you install panels. Companies like Tesla are offering to sell solar panel systems so “homeowners can make money off of their system and put cash back in their pocket.” (Tesla) . Also, many utilities will also offer to buy any excess energy produced by your paneled roof, putting some change into your pocket. A long term investment, some would say. For many in rural areas, solar panels can be used to be more independent and self reliant. Also adding to the practicality of solar panels, the US government has a goal to reduce electric grid emissions by 95 percent by 2035 and 100% in 2050. This means the US government is supporting the plan for about 37-42%  of the US power demand to be serviced by solar panels. Massive solar grids built on lakes and ponds are also being experimented with. The greenhouse gas emission rate will also decrease drastically. This plan is achievable if done and planned well, since previous clean energy growth rates show the possibility of scaling the industry. While this would require increased production of the materials needed, this will also increase the job count, and the expected employment numbers estimate from half a million to 1.5 million jobs, compared to the current 230,000 jobs. Solar panel efficiency will also aid in these endeavors, as promising tech drives plans, though increased storage, flexibility, and resource production will need to catch up. Many businesses like Home Depot sell solar panels, and companies like Tesla, as said before, will also sell solar panel tech. The real fact is that solar panels are a realistic thing, and one can buy one easily. Their practicality can’t go unmentioned, they can make a quick buck on the side as an investment, and there may even be tax cuts and discounts for you if you’re fast and smart enough. It’s not like you can use your roof space for anything else. You might as well put some panels and be closer to self reliance. </p>
<p> Also, many companies like Tesla and Home Depot are willing to sell solar panel tech. You can also hire folks to install it, but you can install it yourself too, like a family project to support your struggling family. You can also make money by selling excess energy you have. These solar panels also increase household value, so when you get tired of your single floor shotgun house and move to a suburban house, you will get some extra property value. For those environmentalists, solar panels bring clean energy and minimal Chinese child labour while not ruining the world. Solar panels and other clean energies are an obvious choice for everyone, with numerous benefits for those involved, and the nonbelievers will stand by the sidelines, standing high and smug, until reality hits them like a truck. </p>
