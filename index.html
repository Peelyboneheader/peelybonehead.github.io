  <h1>The Problem of the Overconsumption of Fossil-Fuel Sourced Energy in the United States</h1>
  <h2>And Why the Solution to that is Solar Panels </h2>
<p>As you wander down the sidewalk in your city, you smell and taste something odd but don't see anything. Then, suddenly, a burning sensation rips throughout your throat, and you cough and cough over and over. Soon, your coughing fit ends, leaving you to wonder what almost killed you. The answer: Gasoline </p>

  <h2>Why Gasoline Harms the Environment</h2>
  
  <h4>The Negative Impacts of Fossil Fuel Energy: Climate Change</h4>
  <p>The use of fossil fuels—mainly petroleum—engendered climate change in the recent decades. One of the reason how we know that climate change is happening is because the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is far greater than any period of time in the last hundred millennia; the industrial activities that our modern civilization depends on have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from 280 ppm to the staggering amount of 416 ppm in the last 150 years (NASA). This exponential rise of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is due to the uncontrollable use of fossil fuel around the world. Scientists recently predicted many effects of our headstrong ignorance of climate change. The changes are at such a grand scale that it is difficult for people to wrap their minds around the global catastrophes predicted in the years to come. One future consequence of climate change is that the temperatures will continue to rise at an alarming rate. More people will have severe sunburns and skin cancer as well as suffer from heat stroke. The burning temperatures will cause droughts that will make prosperous farms very arid and expired, which accordingly will result in millions of desperate people migrating. Turbulent waves of migration more often than not result in catastrophic effects for the whole of humanity, with regards to the global economy, social order, and prosperity (Abrahm Lustgarten, Where Will They Go). The frequent droughts that sweep the farmlands will also inevitably result in cataclysmic hunger and malnutrition crisis all over the globe. In addition, wildfires will become more frequent due to the aridity of dry lands. The wildfires will slaughter millions of innocent animals and destroy entire forests. The warmer temperatures will also warm our oceans as it absorbs heat waves; it will result in enormously strong and frequent hurricanes that will sink islands like Japan and New Zealand and swarm the edges of all coastlines (NASA). The warmer temperatures will melt the mountains such as the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa. They will also melt Antarctica and the Arctic poles in the North and South. In fact, studies show that all areas surrounding the North pole will melt before the mid century (NASA). The molten water will then raise the sea level up to eight feet by 2100 and will continue to rise for a long time since oceans take a long time to respond to warmer conditions on the Earth’s surface (NASA). The additional heat waves on the Earth's air will make the water vapors evaporate more and more therefore increase heat being trapped under the Earth's atmosphere. The evaporated water will then pour down on Earth all at once, causing problems such as irregular precipitation patterns, intensive hail and rain, huge floods, and crop failures. In terms of crops, frost-free seasons and growing seasons will lengthen; this will make growing crops monumentally more difficult (NASA). Other effects of climate change include health risks through air temperatures, water crisis, increasing spread of pests and pathogens, loss of biodiversity, ocean acidification, and much more (NASA). Because of these catastrophic effects on earth, many people will die more than ever and migrate due to loss of jobs. The balance of socioeconomic status of the world will crumble, and hence riots are likely to frequent the streets and anarchy might arise in many nations. Many of these effects are already taking place all over the world and it will worsen if we do not limit and stop our fossil fuel-sourced energy consumption.</p>
<p>Also, A spill or accident can and will pose a massive danger to civilian businesses and households. In many cases, they can be contained and land be evacuated. However, there will still be massive explosions leaving casualties. They can also, if evacuated, cause economic impacts as businesses will not be able to have customers. As someone who knows small business owners, knowing they are not able to serve the community, making thousands of lives happier, and selling something people want, and then closing down and having millions in debt would absolutely ruin their lives just from a loose spill of deadly, dangerous petroleum would break me.</p>
