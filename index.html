  <h1>The Problem of the Overconsumption of Fossil-Fuel Sourced Energy in the United States</h1>
  <h2>And Why the Solution to that is Solar Panels </h2>
<p>As you wander down the sidewalk in your city, you smell and taste something odd but don't see anything. Then, suddenly, a burning sensation rips throughout your throat, and you cough and cough over and over. Soon, your coughing fit ends, leaving you to wonder what almost killed you. The answer: Gasoline </p>

  <h2>How Gasoline has Negative Effects</h2>
  
  <h3>The Negative Impacts of Fossil Fuel Energy: Climate Change and Our Society</h3>
  <p>The use of fossil fuels—mainly petroleum—engendered climate change in the recent decades. One of the reason how we know that climate change is happening is because the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is far greater than any period of time in the last hundred millennia; the industrial activities that our modern civilization depends on have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from 280 ppm to the staggering amount of 416 ppm in the last 150 years (NASA). This exponential rise of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is due to the uncontrollable use of fossil fuel around the world. Scientists recently predicted many effects of our headstrong ignorance of climate change. The changes are at such a grand scale that it is difficult for people to wrap their minds around the global catastrophes predicted in the years to come. One future consequence of climate change is that the temperatures will continue to rise at an alarming rate. More people will have severe sunburns and skin cancer as well as suffer from heat stroke. The burning temperatures will cause droughts that will make prosperous farms very arid and expired, which accordingly will result in millions of desperate people migrating. Turbulent waves of migration more often than not result in catastrophic effects for the whole of humanity, with regards to the global economy, social order, and prosperity (Abrahm Lustgarten, Where Will They Go). The frequent droughts that sweep the farmlands will also inevitably result in cataclysmic hunger and malnutrition crisis all over the globe. In addition, wildfires will become more frequent due to the aridity of dry lands. The wildfires will slaughter millions of innocent animals and destroy entire forests. The warmer temperatures will also warm our oceans as it absorbs heat waves; it will result in enormously strong and frequent hurricanes that will sink islands like Japan and New Zealand and swarm the edges of all coastlines (NASA). The warmer temperatures will melt the mountains such as the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa. They will also melt Antarctica and the Arctic poles in the North and South. In fact, studies show that all areas surrounding the North pole will melt before the mid century (NASA). The molten water will then raise the sea level up to eight feet by 2100 and will continue to rise for a long time since oceans take a long time to respond to warmer conditions on the Earth’s surface (NASA). The additional heat waves on the Earth's air will make the water vapors evaporate more and more therefore increase heat being trapped under the Earth's atmosphere. The evaporated water will then pour down on Earth all at once, causing problems such as irregular precipitation patterns, intensive hail and rain, huge floods, and crop failures. In terms of crops, frost-free seasons and growing seasons will lengthen; this will make growing crops monumentally more difficult (NASA). Other effects of climate change include health risks through air temperatures, water crisis, increasing spread of pests and pathogens, loss of biodiversity, ocean acidification, and much more (NASA). Because of these catastrophic effects on earth, many people will die more than ever and migrate due to loss of jobs. The balance of socioeconomic status of the world will crumble, and hence riots are likely to frequent the streets and anarchy might arise in many nations. Many of these effects are already taking place all over the world and it will worsen if we do not limit and stop our fossil fuel-sourced energy consumption.</p>
<p>Also, A spill or accident can and will pose a massive danger to civilian businesses and households. In many cases, they can be contained and land be evacuated. However, there will still be massive explosions leaving casualties. They can also, if evacuated, cause economic impacts as businesses will not be able to have customers. As someone who knows small business owners, knowing they are not able to serve the community, making thousands of lives happier, and selling something people want, and then closing down and having millions in debt would absolutely ruin their lives just from a loose spill of deadly, dangerous petroleum would break me.</p>

  <h3>Effects of Fossil Fuels on The Environment</h3>
<p>Oil leakages and accidents can be detrimental to local wildlife, like a forest or ocean environment, which can then go on to affect humans and their daily lives. Moreover, they take up a massive amount of space reserved for wildlife—over 12 million acres of public space equivalent to about 6 Yellowstone National Parks—thus removing large amounts of vegetation from these sites.</p>
<p>Air pollution from burning gas and environmental pollution from spilling and improper disposal can cause drastic effects on plants and animals. Humans are already affected by pollution, with 8 million men, women, and children killed each year. Think of the drastic effect that would happen to poor plants and animals just trying to live their life. Plants would be choked to death when faced deep in gas and animals regularly die from gas poisoning. Gas leakage also inflames climate change, feeding the fire for more environmental damage. Which will lead to rising oceans, and the eventual need to relocate billions from the coasts.</p>

     <p>Major spills like the BP oil spill cause drastic effects on marine life too. These oil spills will ruin oceanic ecosystems. This will poison local wildlife, including fish, which will swim all the way to the coast of our shores, and when caught and sold, can inflict poisoning, even if you were nowhere near the spill. 1 million birds alone died from the spill, ~60,000 sea turtles were killed, and all cetaceans nearby were found to be affected by the spill. Dolphins and whales became plagued with sickness from ingesting loose oil in the water. The spill worsened the endangered status of many species in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

  <h3>Potential Negative Effects on Our World</h3>
  <p>Fossil fuels are starting to run out as they are a finite resource at the rate we are consuming it. However, many developing countries are building their economies and livelihoods off of oil and would struggle to survive in an oil free world, worsening many situations for innocent souls. World oil reserves are running out and are expected to dry up by around 2060, and finding/drilling more, deeper oil would be expensive.</p>
<p> There are many ideas to drill for oil reserves that are deeper in our Earth's crust, with one of the most promising being Hydrofracking, which is a method of blasting water into the ground to make it easier to find. However, it is extremely expensive and can destroy ecosystems, by means of leaking massive amounts of methane into our atmosphere. Worsening global warming, and since there are no good ways to fetch that deep oil, since they are too expensive.</p>
<p>Losing all the oil will cause a major economic impact if it goes away, which is coming soon. Many countries are heavily reliant on oil, like Saudi Arabia, which has 46% of their GDP from oil and will be shaken from a world with less oil reliance. 8 countries in the world have above 90% of their exports being fuel, like oil and natural gas and such. 22 Countries have 50% or above of their exports being fuel. Many nations, mostly developing, are relying on their oil to make money, a finite resource that will run out in an estimated 50 years at our current consumption rate, a rate that grows every hour of the second, every minute of the day and will most likely exhaust our reserves faster. Those who will have their economies crashed by more expensive oil prices will be spiraling into a hole of debt and suffering, ruining the already struggling 6.61 dollars in South Africa and related countries to having no job exacerbating their poverty. </p>
